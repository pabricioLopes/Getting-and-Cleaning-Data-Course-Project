# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this Readme is to explain how to collect, work and clean a data set. In addition, a tidy data set was prepared to be used in further analysis.
This repository submitted by Pabr√≠cio Lopes contains instructions on how to perform the analysis on the human activity recognition data set.

# The project Data set

A complete description is available on the website where the data was obtained:

# Files

* `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

* `run_analysis.R` performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition:
    + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
* `Final_Data.txt` is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
